Big. Dick. Energy. That's what I got!
When I walk down the street, they know who's boss.
With every step, I exude confidence and power,
A force to be reckoned with every hour.

I'm not one to shy away from a challenge,
My attitude and presence, they can't unbalance.
I own my space, every inch of it,
And when I speak, they can't help but submit.

Some call it swagger, some call it swag,
But I know it's just the confidence I have.
Big. Dick. Energy. That's what I got,
And when I enter a room, they all stop.

It's not just about physical size or shape,
It's a state of mind that makes the world shake.
So, yeah, I'm proud of what I've got,
Big. Dick. Energy. That's what I brought.
